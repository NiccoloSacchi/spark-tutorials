# Spark in Action, 2nd edition – Java, Python, and Scala code for chapter 14

Chapter 14 is about **extending data transformation with UDFs** (user defined functions).

## Lab

Each chapter has one or more labs. Labs are examples used for teaching in the [book](https://www.manning.com/books/spark-in-action-second-edition?a_aid=jgp). You are encouraged to take ownership of the code and modify it, experiment with it, hence the use of the term **lab**. This chapter has several labs.

### Lab \#200

Using a UDF using the dataframe API.

### Lab \#210

Using a UDF using SparkSQL.

### Lab \#900

A simple UDF to see if a value is in range.

### Lab \#910, \#911, and \#912

Attempts at using polymorphism with UDFs.

### Lab \#920

Passing an entire column to a UDF.


## Datasets
